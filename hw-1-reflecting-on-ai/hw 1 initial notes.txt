more widespread use of ai in white collar jobs
these kinds of places are slow to adopt new technologies
from personal experience, many people are used to the way they do things, and are
hesitant to learn something that will take time out of their busy schedules

this will change
companies will more immediately see the economic benefits of utilizing ai,
as they can cut costs by employing less workers
for example, one needs less accountants and economists when a technologically adept,
ai-wielding person can fill out their spreadsheets for them
jobs will initially be displaced, but will eventually be replaced by people proficient
in it, computer programming, and ethics

this problem is exemplified by the luddites in 19th century england
more recently, concerns about truck drivers being replaced by autonomous vehicles
this is not necessarily a bad thing
less accidents
many of these people will go into other industries
more people will go into college, get computer science degrees

more user friendly
advisors that will train employees how to use ai
